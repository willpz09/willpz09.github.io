			<p>A mediocre made for Netflix story that has been told countless times before.</p>
			<p>
				Sanaa Lathan stars in this film as Violet, a professional 
				woman (insert any ambiguous high paying role here) who 
				seemingly has it all and is even expecting to get engaged at 
				her upcoming birthday party. Things begin to take a turn for 
				the worse rather quickly when things don’t go as planned 
				(sound familiar yet). These events result in what I can only 
				describe as a mini psychological breakdown for Violet; 
				causing her to cut off the thing she sees as her biggest 
				stressor, all of her hair. I’m going to give you my opinion 
				on the good, the bad, and my rating for this movie. Possible 
				spoilers ahead.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, I’ll start with the good news. The cinematography is 
				high quality. There are no bad effects or strange camera 
				transitions. Each scene flows nicely into the next. You feel 
				as if you are getting a glimpse of a short period in the main 
				characters life. I like that the story gets to Violet’s 
				breakdown quickly then spends the rest of the film depicting 
				her recovery. With a film like this it is necessary to get 
				straight to the point to avoid boring the viewer. I think 
				they understood this and responded accordingly. I also 
				appreciate this film not being a typical love story. I think 
				basing a woman’s “happily ever after” on her ability to get 
				and keep a man would be a serious injustice to the good 
				things this film tries to represent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now for the bad news. The story being told in this movie is 
				unoriginal, painfully unoriginal, and seems dated. I think 
				most women, at the time of this film’s release, know that 
				they can do whatever they want to their hair. This film also 
				seems like it’s rushing to get to the point (maybe the flow 
				isn’t so great, I take back what I said previously). To be 
				fair this movie tries to squeeze a lot into a respectable 98 
				minute window so I appreciate the attempt to stay on focus 
				and keep things moving. Lastly, no one ever brings up the 
				mental health aspect of what is happening in this film. Am I 
				the only one that thinks Violet (Sanaa Lathan) acts strangely 
				at times? This character seems to be having a series of 
				psychiatric episodes and nobody ever suggests maybe she 
				should go to a psychiatrist or see a therapist or seek some 
				kind of help. It’s not normal to completely shave your head 
				(VERY poorly might I add) after a breakup and subsequent 
				failed drunken rebound or dance wildly alone at home after 
				quitting your job out of frustration. I find it hard to 
				believe real adults act like this.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’m not a woman so this film doesn’t really speak to me, but 
				I think the moral of the story is to do what you want with 
				your hair. Want to be natural? Good for you, here’s some 
				natural hair products for you. Want to wear a weave or rock a 
				perm? That’s cool too. There’s no overt bashing of any 
				hairstyle in this film (let’s face it, Sanaa Lathan looks 
				great, it would be hard to bash any hairstyle on her). 
				Although this film is not at all original it was interesting 
				enough to keep me watching. Overall I’m going to give Nappily 
				Ever After:
